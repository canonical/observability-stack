Observability documentation
===========================

Highly-integrated, low-operations observability stack powered by Juju and MicroK8s.

The Canonical Observability Stack (COS Lite) gathers, processes, visualizes, and alerts on telemetry signals generated by workloads running both within, and outside of, Juju.

By leveraging the topology model of Juju to contextualize the data, and charm relations to automate configuration and integration, it provides a low-ops observability suite based on best-in-class, open-source observability tools.

For Site Reliability Engineers, the Canonical Observability Stack provides a turn-key, out-of-the-box solution for improved day 2 operational insight.
